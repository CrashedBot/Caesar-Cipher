Description
The Ceasar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter of a plaintext message by a certain number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.

This project contains two Python files: ciphar_code.py and main.py. The ciphar_code.py file contains the code for the encryption and decryption functions, and the main.py file is the main program that prompts the user for input and calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice.

The encrypt() function takes a plaintext message and a shift number as input, and returns the corresponding encrypted message. The decrypt() function takes an encrypted message and a shift number as input, and returns the corresponding decrypted message.

# Usage
To use this program, clone the repository and run the main.py file in a Python environment. The program will prompt you to choose between encryption and decryption, enter the message to be encrypted/decrypted, and the shift number.

The program will then display the encrypted/decrypted message on the console.
